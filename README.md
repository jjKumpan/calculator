## Install
Make sure you have node installed. See `nodejs.org`.
To check if you have node, run `node -v`. This should show you your current node version.

Install project by running `npm install`.

## Developing
To run the project use `npm run start`.
This will start a developing server on localhost:3000.

## CSS
I used a simple css in App.css wich I think suited the size of the application.
For larger projects where the amout of components grow, I would use styled components,
css modules or css in js depending on the developing teams/projects prefered choice.

## Test
To test run `npm run test`.
Right now there is only a small jest unit test checking the utils, but can be expanded!
